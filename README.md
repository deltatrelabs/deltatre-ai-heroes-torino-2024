In this repository you can find the slides for **RAG-based AI Assistants: from demo to product, addressing real-world challenges** session, presented at [AI Heroes 2024 (Torino & online)](https://aiheroes.it/2024/) on December 11th, 2024.

- **RAG-based AI Assistants: from demo to product, addressing real-world challenges**  
Let’s explore our journey to bring an enterprise assistant into production, addressing the real-world complexities of development and deployment, sharing our experience with security, advanced ETL integrations, automation, and frontend/backend customizations. From a prototype based on Azure OpenAI Chat Playground (aka Bring-Your-Own-Data), we’ll walk you through how we moved to a custom architecture, optimized to meet specific user and business needs, using Microsoft technologies, including Azure AI Search, Semantic Kernel, and Kernel Memory.

  - [Gianni Rosa Gallina](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gianni-rosa-gallina-b206a821/) (Deltatre, Microsoft MVP)
